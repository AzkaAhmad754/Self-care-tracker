    <h1>Self-Care tracker</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Today's fast daily routines make everyone neglect self-care that results in burnt out and<br> depression. Especially for students, for whom stick-to-timetable is a must to survive so they <br> continue their journey towards bright future. To help such individuals, we propose the <br> idea of a self-care tracker application. It will serve as a digital companion offering <br> motivation quotes, to-do lists, tracking exercise routines, and monitoring hydration intake. <br> It will help individuals maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.  </p>
  <h2>Key Features:</h2>
  <p>The self-care tracker will consist of the following features: </p>
  <h3>1. Motivational Quote Greeting: </h3>
    <p>Upon starting the application, the users will get a random motivational greeting from the<br> developers to make them smile at the start of the day. </p>
    <h3>2. To Do List Management: </h3>
    <p>Users will be able to create, edit and mark their to do list. This will make them able to manage<br> their daily routine tasks wisely.</p>
    <h3>3. Exercise Planner: </h3>
    <p>The application will let users keep an eye on their exercise routines. Users will be able to add<br> exercises, edit their names, set durations and get reminders. </p>
    <h3>4. Hydration Tracker: </h3>
    <p>The application will include a hydration tracker that will record water intake. Users can set the<br> amount of water they consume, and the application will help visualize the records <br>of daily and weekly hydration goals. </p>
    <h3>5.Daily Day Checker: </h3>
    <p>This will ask the user about how the day went on the scale of one to ten, if they reached their<br> daily goals, and if they did something to be proud of. The response will be based <br>on the user’s response. </p>
    <h2>Description of Algorithm: </h2>
    <p>The programme is designed to personalize the user’s own self-care tracker in the way he/she wants to<br> use it. The programme consists of five major parts which includes a random quote generator, <br>to-do list, exercise planner, hydration tracker and daily day checker. <br><br> 

  

First, the user is asked to enter one of five inputs to have one of the following tools to customize.<br><br>

If (3); Opens Hydration Tracker <br> 

If (4); Opens Exercise Planner <br> 

If (5); Opens Daily Day Checker <br> 

If (6); Exits the Programme <br> <br> 

  

When Random Quote Generator is opened, it generates a random quote using rand operator. <br> <br> 

  

When To-do list is opened, it shows the following menu: <br>

2. View task (View tasks you’ve added by entering 2) <br> 

3. Mark Task as done (Mark your tasks as done after completing by pressing 3) <br> 

4. Exit (Exit the to-do list by entering 4) <br> <br> 

  

When Hydration Tracker is opened, it shows the following menu: <br> 

1. Update your daily hydration goal (Updates your hydration goals by entering 1) <br> 

2. Add your glasses consumed (Adds your daily glasses by entering 2) <br> 

3. View current hydration (Shows your hydration track when entered 3) <br> 

4. Recommend a hydration goal (Recommends you a goal by pressing 4) <br> 

5. Exit (Exits the hydration Tracker by pressing 5) <br> <br> 

  

When Exercise Planner is opened, it shows the following menu: <br> 

1. Create your own exercise planner (Make your own exercise planner (Asks you at least 5 exercises to add) by entering 1) <br>

3. Display Exercise Progress (Displays the track of your exercise when entered 3) <br> 

4. Exit (Exits the Exercise Planner by pressing 4) <br> 

  

When Daily Day Checker is opened, asks how your day went, responds accordingly and it asks you if you <br> have finished today’s goals or not. Also if you did something to be proud of today. 

 </p>
<h2>Future Updates:</h2> 

<p>Following are some of he future updates that can upgrade the program :</p> 

<h3>Application of GUI’s:</h3> 

<p>Graphics can be added to our project to enhance it’s display.</p> 

<h3>Integration with External API’s:</h3> 

<p>This feature can make this program able to fetch data from online relevant resources.</p> 

<h3>Data Persistence:</h3> 

<p>This feature enables the program to store the data to the either an online storage or a device<br> internal storage.<br><br> 

 

 

.................................................................................................<br> It may be primitive right now, but once updated to a proper program it can prove to be a go <br>to app for every individual working on self-improvement.<br> 

|Because we believe in giving the best you can instead of being the best out there.|<br>
