    <h1>Self-Care tracker</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Today's fast daily routines make everyone neglect self-care that results in burnt out and<br> depression. Especially for students, for whom stick-to-timetable is a must to survive so they <br> continue their journey towards bright future. To help such individuals, we propose the <br> idea of a self-care tracker application. It will serve as a digital companion offering <br> motivation quotes, to-do lists, tracking exercise routines, and monitoring hydration intake. <br> It will help individuals maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.  </p>
